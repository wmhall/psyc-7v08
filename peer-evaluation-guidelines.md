# Guidelines for peer review of assignments: 

 As part of this course you will be reviewing and commenting on other students' homework assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course and you will be marked on your peer reviews (10% of overall course mark). 

Your peer review will be shared with the person you were assigned. 

## How to do peer review well: 

  * Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments. 
  * Be specific and concise.
  * Use [general homeowork rubric](general-rubric.md) to for ideas about criteria to evaluate and comment on
  * Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.
  * If you can't find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.

## How you will be marked: 

* Each peer review will be marked on the following scale: 
    * 0 = not constructive/mean
    * 1 = needs more
    * 2 = great  

* These points will be totaled over all assignments to form your peer review mark.

* Hallmarks of the “not constructive/mean” feedback:
    * Your review is mean
    * There is no evidence that you tried to engage with the person's code.
    
* Hallmarks of “needs more” feedback:
    * Your review is so generic that it could be applied to anyone
    * Your review is overly negative.
    * You can’t find anything to praise/learn and you don’t offer any suggestions either.

## How to submit your peer review:

For each peer review submission, create an R project (e.g., `peer-review-hw01.Rproj`). 

Use R Markdown to write your peer reviews. Using R Markdown will allow you to easily reference code snippets.E.g., 

> It was awesome when you did this. It helped me learn about X.

```
#cool code here
```
 
Using the `eval = FALSE` option in R Markdown will be helpful here. It will allow you to paste snippets of code into your peer review without worrying about whether it works as standalone piece of code.  
 
Create separate RMDs for each peer review. Output your RMDs to HTML. 

**Important: In the body your RMD, put the OneDrive link to the homework you are reviewing.** This should be the link that you were emailed when I assigned your peer review. E.g.,

> This is my peer review for the homework submission: *LINK TO SUBMISSION*

Using Sakai, submit a OneDrive link to your R project. See the [general homework guidelines](hw00_homework-guidelines.md) for submission instructions.

Peer reviewing and critiquing others' work is a useful skill to develop during your graduate studies. Although these links deal mainly with the peer review of academic papers, most of the key points are applicable to our peer review process.
