### Overview

The goal of homework 4 is to learn more about `map` functions from the
`purrr` package.

### `Purrr`’s `map()` functions

`Purrr` provides a set of `map` functions (`map()`, `map_lgl()`,
`map_chr()`, `map_int()`, `map_dbl()`, `map_raw()`, `map_df()`,
`map_dfr()`, `map_dfc()`, `walk()`) that allow you to apply a function
to each element of a list or simple vector.

These functions can be used to solve a variety of problems that require
iteration.

For example, below, I use `map()` to compute the correlation between the
`mpg` variable and all the other variables in the `mtcars` dataset.

``` r
mtcars %>% 
    map(~cor.test(., mtcars$mpg)) %>% 
    map_df(tidy) %>% 
    mutate(name = names(mtcars))
```

### Your mission, high-level

Write a tutorial demonstrating **two** different `map` functions. Use
the `map` functions to solve a problem that interests you.

Your tutorial should teach someone how to use your chosen `map()`
functions. You can assume that person is in our course and knows as much
*R* as we’ve covered thus far.

### The specifics

Teach someone how to use **two** of these functions: `map()`,
`map_lgl()`, `map_chr()`, `map_int()`, `map_dbl()`, `map_raw()`,
`map_dfr()`, `map_dfc()`, `map_if()`, `map_at()`, `walk()`.

You will teach these `map` functions by demonstrating how they can be
used to solve a problem. You get to pick the problem and the data you
use. You can pick separate problems (one per `map` function) or could
use two `map` functions in concert to solve a single problem (like I did
above).

Walk your reader through how the map function works. Take a look at the
[RStudio primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) on iteration if
you need help explaining how to use the map functions.

Compare the two `map` functions and describe when one type of `map`
might be more useful than the other, and vice versa.

### I want to do more!

`Purrr` has several advanced `map` functions (e.g., `map2()`, `pmap()`,
`pwalk()`) that allow you to solve increasingly complex iteration
problems. Pick one of these functions and demonstrate how it works.

### What should I do?

#### Picking data

Remember that all data frames are lists, so you can use `map` to apply
functions to any data frame we’ve covered in the course or a data set of
your choosing. When mapping functions to data frames, you’ll need to
consider the data type of the columns. If you `map` `mean()` to a data
frame of character vectors, you aren’t going to have a happy time.

Your tutorial doesn’t need to focus on data frames. For example, you
might want to iterate over a vector of characters or numbers.

#### Picking a problem

Try to make the tutorial useful for future you. What type of tasks do
you commonly do in your research? Could they be streamlined with
`purrr`?

At the end of the class on `purrr`, I showed you a few different ideas
for problems you could solve with `purrr`, feel free to use those as
inspiration.

You might take a look at the [RStudio
primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) on iteration for ideas of
problems to solve.

Finally, the problem you pick doesn’t need to be complex. You simply
need something that allows you to demonstrate your understanding of the
`map` functions.

#### Ask for help

If you have trouble with this homework, please email me to ask for
advice.

### Report your process

You’re encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved,
helpful tutorials you read, etc. Give credit to your sources, whether
it’s a blog post, a fellow student, an online tutorial, etc.

### Rubric

As always, refer to the [general rubric](general-rubric.md) for
guidelines on how we’ll be grading.

Check minus: Reproduced something we covered in class or a very modest
extension. The tutorial is difficult to understand. There is no obvious
effort to explore the differences between the two `map()` functions you
cover. Or more than one technical problem that is relatively easy to
fix. It’s hard to find the report in your Rproject folder

Check: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No
heroic detective work is required. Solid.

Check plus: Exceeded the requirements in a number of tasks. Or developed
novel approaches that were indeed interesting and “worked”. Impressive
use of `purrr` to meet the goals of the assignment. Thoughtful
application of the `map` functions to solving your chosen problem.
Impeccable organization of your report. We learned something new from
reviewing your work and are eager to incorporate it into our work.
